    "text": " Hey bro, we'll be making fun of our parents for believing everything on the internet, but don't act like this man didn't have us all fooled me, Dan. And you see, Dan had a problem. His life was crumbling before his very eyes, because you see, his living was based off of you believing he was rich. Listen, when you're a public figure and you have a company, stocks go up and down depending on you. Think about Elon Musk. When people like Elon Musk stocks rise when people didn't like him, stocks crash. Dan had this company called Ignite. Now it was all fun and games until he fired his vice president. His vice president said, you don't want to do that. That said, what you're going to do about his vice president said, that's it. What? He said, I'm fun to get my get back. Oh, and he got his get back. One of the petty smooths I've ever seen his vice president soaps him for wrongful termination, but that wasn't why he sued him. He sued him so he can show the world how Dan was really spending his money. So just a surwire you hear today, he said, um, all the girls that he's he down what he just be running. Then he just be flying in my dance set objection to just say, hold on, I want to hear this. He said, yeah, that man, and he said he bought. He just rinsed that too. He don't really got the money to afford it. The judge said, all right, hold on. Sir, all right, how is this relevant? He said, I'm gonna get to that. All the money, damn, he's spending all stuff. That's all the company's money. He don't really got money like that. He don't got bread like that. That said, all right, come on. Now, how's Dan being a bum relevant dance set objection? The VP said, I don't got that down. The typewriter said, oh, I got it right here. Now, as soon as the whole world hears this dance stock start the plummet. But remember how I told you they'd be going up and down and up and down depending on the person, his stock start to rise again because he gets a new business advisor. But when they hear about who his business advisor was, it starts to plummet again because the business advisor was none other than his father, Paul Bill Zarian, and here's where things start to get wicked. See, Paul Bill Zarian was not allowed to technically be his advisor. Why you ask? Well, because he's a felon, a certified scam artist, he specialized in corporate takeovers and was really good at hiding money. Then he was ordered to pay all of that money back. He said, I don't got it. So he filed for bankruptcy. Let's see, then people started to ask, Dan, how did you get all this money to start your company in the first place? And that goes to how Dan started being famous in the first place. He first came out as a professional poker player, making a huge blast because he was very extravagant. He then claims to have $150 million in a year. Poker player said, cap, he said, prove it. He said that poker series you played in you was a hundred and eighty of the place. I seen you play. You're not that good. Almost seemed like you just wanted people to know you played poker. He said, let me just stop you right there. I don't play against famous players. Dummy. I play against billionaires on the low secretly. So you can't prove it. Look who incidentally, he started making a big splash in the poker scene around when his trust fund was activated. He then starts his company and then they find out the person who gave him all that money. And the first place was helping him run his company in the background. And now the FBI gets involved. Could you see part of his conviction was if your name and company come up in the same sentence, we've been again on your ass. Paul said, oh, I ain't going back to a pen. He said, I was just helping my son out for free because he was screwing up all his money. His son says, I'm not close to my dad. I'm human. No, I'm like that. FBI says, oh, you must think we stupid. So a judge orders dance company to give them financial documents. Dance company literally says, objects in the judge said, boy, the judge starts hitting them will find after fine after fine for every day he doesn't give the document. Now his dad said they eventually handed over the documents. They asked him in an interview. You think the FBI was just trying to get the get back on you? He said maybe after this his company stock collapses so hard he had to pull it off to stock market. And as his company stock is decreasing, so his real life stock is losing millions upon millions of followers a day. Well, then he comes down and says, I'm broke y'all, but see once a scammer always a scammer, he pivots to the easiest scam that you can do. scamming dumb insecure men into believing that he can turn you into a man. He starts hanging out with Andrew Tays starts saying that I'm going to teach men how to be sigma. As Dan is not your father and who's not your brother, you're just a customer.",
