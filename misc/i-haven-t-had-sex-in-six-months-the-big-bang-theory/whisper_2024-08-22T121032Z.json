    "text": " Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty? Yes, I can't get my stupid door open. You appear to have put your car key in the door lock. Are you aware of that? Yeah. Yeah. All right then. Do you have a damn camera camera camera camera camera camera? Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly? Can't get the damn key out. Well it's not surprising. That bald windlock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagen uses a center cylinder system. Thank you Sheldon. You're welcome. Point of inquiry. Why did you put your car key in the door lock? Why I'll tell you why, because today I had an audition that took me two hours to get there. I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked to Midwest for the part. To Midwest, what the hell does that even mean? Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian intermaniators. Well they have a characteristic face of value. I don't even know what it means Sheldon! Oh my, you know I have been in LA for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job. I have accomplished nothing. I haven't gotten a raise at work. I haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs, a fly flu in my mouth, and I ate it! Well actually insects are a dietary staple in many cultures. They're almost pure protein. Oh son of a bitch! I believe the condensation on your frozen foods, weak in the structural integrity of the bat. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you. I did! He said he'll get here when he gets here. I'm your frustrated because he phrases reply in the form of a meaningless topology. No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly! They're there! Would you prefer to wait in our apartment? Well then I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year old! Alright then? I've got to sleep! Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm!",
