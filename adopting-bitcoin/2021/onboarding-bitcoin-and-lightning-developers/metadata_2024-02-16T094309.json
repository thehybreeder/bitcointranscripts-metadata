And what can companies do to solve this problem? What are some of the resources available to help both talents and companies find each other?\n\nPanelists:\nWill Clark - Lightning Application Engineer at Global Mesh Labs\nGloria Zhao - Brink Fellow, Bitcoin Core Contributor\nAdam Jonas - Qala\nJonas Nick - Bitcoin Research Blockstream\nHost: Pablo Fernandez\n\nGloria is a Bitcoin Core developer and fellow at Brink who focuses mainly on mempool validation and transaction relay. She is currently working on Package Mempool Accept.\n\nWill Clark is a Lightning Application Engineer at Global Mesh Labs developing an approach to paying Lightning invoices over the goTenna Mesh network and integrating the public goTenna Mesh SDK into a system using open-source Bitcoin Lightning.\n\nJonas Nick has been a Bitcoin developer with Blockstream since 2015. He is currently working in the research group focused on signatures and script languages like Miniscript and Simplicity for the Bitcoin protocol, wallets, the Elements sidechain and the Lightning Network. He is also a contributor to free and open source projects like Bitcoin Core, libsecp, rust-bitcoin and many others.
